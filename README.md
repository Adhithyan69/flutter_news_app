MVVM Pattern: For clean separation of UI, logic, and data.

State Management: Provider (or preferred solution) to handle app state.

Modular File Structure for scalability and maintainability:

| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `news_api_flutter_package` | Easy integration with News API to fetch news articles |
| `http`                     | (If used additionally) for general network calls      |
| `provider`                 | State management                                      |
| `shared_preferences`       | Save login session and bookmarks                      |
